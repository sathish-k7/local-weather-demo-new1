## Overview
This project is a simple web app where a user can enter a city's name and receive current weather data for the location. The app uses Bootstrap 5 for stylish elements and JavaScript fetch() to connect with the Open-Meteo public API.

## Setup
1. Install a web server to host the files, or use a localhost (like Apache or Nginx).
2. Place the index.html file in your hosting directory.

## Usage
1. Open the webpage in your preferred web browser.
2. Enter the name of the city you want to lookup into the text box and click the "Get Weather" button.
3. The current temperature and humidity for the specified city will be displayed on the screen.

## Improvements (if any)
